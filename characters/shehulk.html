                    <p>Jennifer Walters was born to Morris and Elaine Walters and grew up in Los Angeles, California.
                        She would go on to befriend Lulu while in high school but lose touch after heading to college.
                        Walters attended the University of California, Los Angeles.[1] While there, she went to parties,
                        and recorded a video of her dancing with her friends, which she sent to her mother.[6] Walters
                        would earn two degrees, and became a lawyer, going on to work as a Deputy District Attorney at
                        the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jennifer Sue "Jen" Walters, Esq. is a former attorney at Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway
                        and former Deputy District Attorney for the City of Los Angeles. After coming into contact with
                        her cousin Bruce Banner's blood, she underwent a physical transformation similar to his and
                        became known as She-Hulk. She was then hired by GLK&H to be the face of their Superhuman Law
                        Division. Walters took on many cases, including that of Abomination and Wong, while also getting
                        herself in conflict with as Titania. Her rising fame soon got the ire of the online hate-group
                        Intelligencia, who would later hijack the Southern California Law Awards Gala and released
                        footage they had obtained of her having sex in order to make her lose control. Walters was
                        stopped and detained by the United States Department of Damage Control and later released under
                        the condition that she would no longer transform into She-Hulk. At a final confrontation with
                        Intelligencia, Walters broke through the fourth wall in order to rewrite the ending to allow
                        herself to be She-Hulk once more.
                    </p>

                    <img class="w-50 mx-3 my-2 img-fluid rounded float-start imgshadow"
                        src="https://www.laughingplace.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jen-walters-and-bruce-banner-get-into-a-crash-in-new-she-hulk-attorney-at-law-clip.jpg"
                        alt="shehulk">
                    <p>In 2025, Walters caught up with Bruce Banner, and the two went on a road trip together. During
                        the drive, Walters asked Banner what he had been up to, which he explained in detail how he
                        built a device that kept him in human form while he healed his arm. Walters then turned the
                        conversation to her theory that Steve Rogers was a virgin, going through what she learned from
                        the History Channel and Banner's stories, which made him uncomfortable.

                        A spaceship suddenly appeared in front of them, causing Walters to veer off the road and crash
                        down a hill. Walters cut herself as she got out of the car, and went to pull Banner out, but he
                        tried to tell her to get away from him as he was bleeding. But before she could, some of
                        Banner's blood spilled into her open wound, sending Gamma Radiation through her bloodstream,
                        transforming Walters into a Hulk. In shock, Walters ran off into the forest.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img class="w-50 mx-3 my-2 img-fluid rounded float-end imgshadow"
                        src="https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/she-hulk-powers-bruce-blood.png"
                        alt="shehulk">
                    <p>Walters woke up in the forest at night. She checked herself out and then walked out to a clearing
                        where saw the Ideal Sports Bar. She went inside the back door and went to the restroom to clean
                        up. She then was met by a group of women who came in and noticed how dirty she was, concluding
                        that she had a run in with a man. They sympathized for her and fixed her up by doing her makeup
                        and gave her new shoes. She thanked them, but said she didn't need makeup, just their phones.
                        She used one of their phones to call Banner to come pick her up. As she waited outside for her
                        cousin to arrive, a few men started harassing her, so Walters tried to avoid the situation by
                        walking away, only to be followed. Walters lost her anger and lashed out, turning into a Hulk,
                        terrifying the group of men. Before she could attack, Banner tackled her, knocking her out.</p>
                    <p>Once Bruce Banner destroyed all samples of Walter's blood, she asked him to fix what had happened
                        to her, but he told her that it was irreversible and that she could never return to her normal
                        life. To help cope with the situation, Banner made Walters pancakes and explained that she would
                        have to stay with him as she spent years coming to terms with her Hulk self, much to her
                        frustration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of their first test, Walters was put in a chamber to test what her threshold was for
                        triggering her transformation. As buzzsaws began closing in on her, Walters panicked and was
                        forced to transform so she could break out of the chamber. Banner tried to calm her Hulk self
                        down, but they discovered that Walters was still in control, much to their surprise. With no
                        alter ego to battle with, Walters believed she was finished, but Banner made it clear she had
                        more to learn, so Walters reluctantly agreed to continue their training.
