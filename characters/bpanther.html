                    <p>Shuri is the Princess of Wakanda, youngest child of T'Chaka and Ramonda, sister of T'Challa, and
                        the leader of the Wakandan Design Group. An innovator responsible for creating much of Wakanda's
                        modern technology, she is also known for designing the current generation Panther Habits. After
                        her brother's coronation, Shuri assisted him and the Dora Milaje in tracking down Ulysses Klaue,
                        only to be forced to flee the Golden City as Erik Killmonger overthrew the throne, eventually
                        returning to reclaim Wakanda. Shortly after, Shuri succeeded in eliminating the HYDRA
                        programming from Bucky Barnes' mind.

                        Two years later, she was tasked by her brother and the Avengers in removing the Mind Stone from
                        Vision's head, as the android was under threat from Thanos. She was soon compromised and
                        defeated by Corvus Glaive. Shortly after, she was among the many who died when Thanos completed
                        the Infinity Gauntlet and wiped out half of all life in the universe. She was resurrected by
                        Hulk five years later, where she participated in the final battle against Thanos.
                    </p>

                    <p> Heartbroken by T'Challa's sudden death, Shuri had to face the threat of Namor and the Talokanil
                        who wanted to wage war on the surface world and protect their home. As Shuri was trying to save
                        Riri Williams, Namor proposed her a military alliance but in the end, the Talokanil declared war
                        on Wakanda, leading to Namor killing Ramonda. Devastated, Shuri yearned for vengeance and
                        managed to synthesize a Heart-Shaped Herb, taking on the mantle of Black Panther. Shuri led the
                        Wakandan army in the grand battle against Namor, during which she managed to defeat Namor but
                        decided to spare his life. As the war ended, Shuri decided to leave Wakanda and allowed M'Baku
                        to challenge for the throne, and stayed in Haiti, where Nakia introduced Shuri to her nephew,
                        T'Challa II.

                    <p>
                        This sense of revenge was fully heightened when her mother died not long after as well. When
                        Namor killed Ramonda in his attack on Wakanda, she was filled with vengeance and determination
                        to kill Namor for what he did to her mother, as all her family members have passed away now.
                        Even M'Baku and Nakia understand Shuri's rage, but felt that vengeance would consume her, the
                        same way it had consumed her cousin Nâ€™Jadaka. Her desire for revenge eventually brought her to
                        N'Jadaka in the ancestral plane, where she was persuaded to go on the vengeful ways. She became
                        arrogant and refused to listen to M'Baku's plan of not killing Namor to prevent eternal war,
                        determined to end the war and avenge her fallen family. But when she had the chance of killing
                        Namor after gravely injuring the latter who was dehydrated, she later realized that vengeance is
                        not only consuming Namor, but also herself, and she doesn't want both Wakanda and Talokan being
                        consumed by vengeance, something she learned from her late brother, who went on a similar path
                        as her. She realized the similarities between the Talokan ruler and herself, which led her to
                        propose a truce with the sea-dwellers and finally be able to see her mother in the Ancestral
                        Plane, who encouraged her to be herself once more. After the conflict with Talokan and Namor,
                        the Wakandan princess finally was able to grieve her loss and accept the passing of her brother,
                        and burnt the ceremonial robes in Haiti.
                        Shuri was told by her brother that he had fallen ill from an unknown disease and asked for her
                        help. Shuri then made her top priority to recreate the Heart-Shaped Herb, which she had been
                        studying since her return to life,[7] and hoped it could heal him.Over the next few weeks, Shuri
                        tried every known combination to recreate the herb. Ultimately, T'Challa was in critical
                        condition, while Ramonda and others were next to him, Shuri stayed in her laboratory trying to
                        speed the process. She used Griot's help to run the tests. On her last try, she asked for the
                        confidence interval, which turned out to be less than 30%. After creating it, Shuri grabbed the
                        synthetic herb and tried to rush to her brother, but was stopped by her mother, who confirmed
                        T'Challa's passing. In denial, Shuri asked Griot to reveal what T'Challa's heart rate, which
                        Griot confirmed was non-existent, as the King had indeed passed away.
